## Removing Images

In this project, click on every image you want to remove it but when you click on the last one, a short description of the computer science's branch that this image represents will be displayed. The following methods were used in Javascript to get rid of images with DOM manipulation:

1. addEventListener
2. removeTarget
3. parentNode

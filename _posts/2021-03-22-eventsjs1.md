## Deleting Images

In this project, click on every image you want to remove but when you click on the last one, a short description of the computer science's branch that this image represents will be displayed. I also used the following methods in Javascript to eliminate every image and manipulate DOM:

1. addEventListener
2. removeTarget
3. parentNode

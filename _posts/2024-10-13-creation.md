Hi everyone. I created this blog to show you some of my experiences in programming to automate repetitive tasks using programming languages such as Python or JavaScript and other tech tools.

Some of my posts have two links: the first one will route you to the deployed project, and the second one will take you to the specific repository that contains its source code. Other posts may also include code I wrote to automate taks or just telling you my experiences with general topics in programming.

Because projects are published in cloud-based repositories, you can make your own forks to enhance them. They were released with the purpose of collaborating on open source endeavors.

Finally, if you're a developer or a student, I would be pleased with your interest in the topics published here, so check them to find useful information.

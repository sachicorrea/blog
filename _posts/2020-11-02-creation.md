## Welcome!

Hi everyone. I created this blog to show you some of my front-end projects I've been making using HTML, CSS, JavaScript; also frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap and Jquery. Just click on the tag of your interest and you'll be redirected to the related content.

Some posts, especially those about have two links, the first one is to open the project hosted in Github Pages, the second one address you to the github repository respectively. Other posts, especially those related to more complex projects, includes only a summary of technical notes about how it was made. Some posts can also include links to online IDEs where user can run them.

If you're an employer, a developer or a student I would feel pleased that you are interested in checking my work. Because of these projects are hosted or saved in Github, you are absolutely free to colaborate and enhance them using Forks. They were created and released to collaborate with open source endeavors.

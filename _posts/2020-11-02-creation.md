## Welcome!

Hi everyone. I created this blog to show some of my front-end projects I made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript; also frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap and Jquery. Just click on the tag of your interest and it will be retrived related content.

In every post you can find two related links, the first one open the project hosted in Github Pages. The second one moves you to the github repository where code is hosted. It also includes a summary of technical notes about components and how it was created according to the programming language or framework.

If you're an employer, a developer or a student I would feel pleased that you are interested in to check my work. Because of this website and their content are hosted in Github, you are absolutely free to colaborate and enhance thei projects using Forks. They were created and released just to collaborate to open source code.

## Welcome!

Hi everyone. I created this blog to show you some of my front-end projects I've been made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript; also frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap and Jquery. Just click on the tag of your interest and it will be retrived related content.

In every post you can find two related links, first one is to open the project hosted in Github Pages, the second moves you to the github repository where code is hosted too. It also includes a summary of technical notes about components and how it was made according to the programming language or framework.

If you're an employer, a developer or a student I would feel pleased that you are interested in checking my work. Because of the published projects are hosted in Github, you are absolutely free to colaborate and enhance them using Forks. They were created and released to collaborate with open source endeavors.

## Updated February 11th 2022 - Welcome!

Hi everyone. At first, I created this blog to show you some of my front-end projects using common technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but since I've been going through a few back-end languages and frameworks, I preferred to add posts with common troubles I experienced using them. If you want to filter posts by topic, just click on the tag of your interest.
Posts related to my published projects have two links: the first one will route you to the deployed project, and the second one will take you to the specific repository that contains its source code. Other posts may also include links to online IDEs where you can run them if it's possible.
Because projects are published in cloud-based repositories, you can make your own forks not only to collaborate but to enhance them. They were released with the purpose of collaborating on open source endeavors.
Finally, if you're a developer or a student, I would be pleased with your interest in the topics displayed here, so check the connected content.

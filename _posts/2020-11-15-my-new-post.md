## Welcome!

Hi everyone. I created this blog to show some of my front-end projects I made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap, Sass and Jquery. Just click on the tag of your interest and it will list content related posts.

In every post, you can find two related links, the fist one open the project hosted in github pages. The second link send you to the repository in github which you can check the code it was built. The post also includes a summary about what the project is as well as technical notes about commands, functions, methods and correlated components used according to the language or framework.

If you're an employer, a developer or a student, I would feel happy to display my projects to you. Because of this website and their projects are hosted in github, you are free to colaborate to them through forks. They were thought up and released just to collaborate to open source code.

## Bootstrap forms

Hi everyone. The idea with projects with the bootstrap tag is to display those that are purely made with this framework. This is the first one. And sorry, it was written in Spanish, but the content is worthless. Also I used popper that enrich bootstrap environment with events in JavaScript.

The first part are shows headings and text orientation. They were made with h1 and h2 labels also text classes for the secon case. At the end of the page, I did a striped table with a hover if the cursor is on an specific row. Hover intensity is tenous so keep an eye on it to noticed it.
